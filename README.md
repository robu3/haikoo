# haikoo ðŸ–‹

Haikoo is a fun little haiku generator. It uses [Azure Congnitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/), Markov chains (leveraging [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)), and word syllable counts to create haiku from an image. The text is then overlaid on a cropped version of the original picture to create a consolidated image ready for social media.

Given an image like this:

![Input](/sample_input.jpeg?raw=true)

It produces something like this:

![Output](/sample_output.png?raw=true)

# Basic Usage

Haikoo can be used as module or as a command line utility.

As a module:

```python
from haikoo.haikoo import Haikoo, ImageDescriber

# instantiate image describer and haikoo
# the markov model can be: fusion (recommended), shakespeare, frost, or classic
describer = ImageDescriber("azure_cv_key", "azure_cv_region")
haikoo = Haikoo(describer, "fusion")

# then create your haiku!
haiku = haikoo.create_image(file_path=args.image, out_file_path=args.out, text=args.text)
```

From the terminal:

```
python app.py /path/to/image.png
```

When using the terminal application, you will need to copy config.json.default to config.json and update the file with your Azure CV key and region before beginning.
Let the programmatically generated poetry begin!

# Technical Details

Haikoo extends/subclasses a couple of Markovify's classes in order to create Markov chain models that also take syllable count into consideration when selecting words, i.e., `HaikuChain` and `HaikuText`. `HaikuChain` counts the number of syllables in a word when tokenizing text; the result can be serialized for reuse later, negating the need to count syllables at runtime (a performance win).

# Advanced Usage

The Azure Computer Vision-based `ImageDescriber` can swapped out with another implementation by passing it into the constructor; see the `MockImageDescriber` for an example.

```python
from haikoo.haikoo import Haikoo, MyCustomImageDescriber

describer = MyCustomImageDescriber()
haikoo = Haikoo(describer, "fusion")
```
