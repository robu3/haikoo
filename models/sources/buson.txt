standing still at dusk
listen . . . in far
distances
the song of froglings!

my two plum trees are
so gracious . . .
see, they flower
one now, one later

the laden wagon runs
bumbling and creaking
down the road . . .
three peonies tremble

lightning flash, crash . . .
waiting in the
bamboo grove
see three dew-drops fall

afternoon shower . . .
walking and talking
in the street:
umbrella and raincoat!

sadness at twilight . . .
villain! i have
let my hand
cut that peony

in dim dusk and scent
a witness
now half hidden . . .
evenfall orchid

voices of two bells
that speak from
twilight temples . . .
ah! cool dialogue

deep in dark forest
a woodcutter's
dull axe talking . . .
and a woodcutter

butterfly asleep
folded soft on
temple bell . . .
then bronze gong rang!

see the morning breeze
ruffling his so
silky hair . . .
cool caterpillar

a camellia
dropped down into
still waters
of a deep dark well

in the holy dusk
nightingales begin
their psalm . . .
good! the dinner-gong!

a short summer night . . .
but in this solemn
darkness
one peony bloomed

pebbles shining clear,
and clear
six silent fishes . . .
deep autumn water

a bright autumn moon . . .
in the shadow of
each grass
an insect chirping

white chrysanthemum . . .
before that
perfect flower
scissors hesitate

at furue in rain
gray water and
grey sand . . .
picture without lines

the old fisherman
unalterably
intent . . .
cold evening rain

rainy-month, dripping
on and on
as i lie abed . . .
ah, old man's memories!

slanting lines of rain . . .
on the dusty
samisen
a mouse is trotting

old weary willows . . .
i thought how long
the road would be
when you went away


scampering over saucers -
the sound of a rat.
cold. cold.

spring rain;
telling a tale as they go,
straw cape, umbrella.

spring rain:
in our sedan
your soft whispers.

sudden shower:
grasping the grass-blades
a shoal of sparrows.

mosquito-buzz
whenever honeysuckle
petals fall.
